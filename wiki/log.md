# Rhino wiki — log

Append-only history of this wiki, newest entry at the bottom. Every entry starts with `## [YYYY-MM-DD] op | Title`
(ops: `init`, `seed`, `ingest`, `query`, `lint`, `update`); see [SCHEMA.md](SCHEMA.md).

## [2026-10-03] init | Wiki created

## [2026-10-03] seed | Wiki seeded from the codebase
- source: the code in `native/` and `instruments/rhino-forge/`, the repository's docs (AGENTS.md, README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, HANDOVER.md, SESSION-VIEW.md, INSTRUMENT_PLAN.md, native/README.md, research/, Forge README/PLAN/SPECTRAL/HANDOVER-M9B) and the agents' working notes; raw/ is empty. Every page was checked against the code on 2026-10-03.
- updated: overview.md, index.md
- created: pages/adding-a-device.md, pages/app-icon-baked-at-configure.md, pages/app-shell.md, pages/append-only-stored-indices.md, pages/arrangement-view.md, pages/audio-clip-editor.md, pages/automation.md, pages/browser.md, pages/build-and-test-forge.md, pages/build-and-test-rhino.md, pages/built-in-devices.md, pages/clip-placement.md, pages/cmake-does-not-reconfigure.md, pages/colours-and-typography.md, pages/comparing-forge-with-serum.md, pages/computer-keyboard.md, pages/content-is-files.md, pages/content-library.md, pages/debugging-a-crashing-project.md, pages/dependency-direction.md, pages/development-environment.md, pages/device-catalog.md, pages/device-chain-order.md, pages/device-rack.md, pages/displays-draw-from-the-dsp.md, pages/doc-drift.md, pages/driving-the-forge-standalone.md, pages/executable-named-rhinodaw.md, pages/forge-arpeggiator.md, pages/forge-doc-drift.md, pages/forge-editor.md, pages/forge-engine-headers-only.md, pages/forge-engine.md, pages/forge-filter.md, pages/forge-fx-slots-have-generic-parameters.md, pages/forge-hosting.md, pages/forge-is-an-independent-vst3.md, pages/forge-knob-diameter-is-panel-wide.md, pages/forge-midi-learn.md, pages/forge-mixer-and-fx.md, pages/forge-modulation.md, pages/forge-noise.md, pages/forge-oscillators.md, pages/forge-panel-repaint-cost.md, pages/forge-presets-and-state.md, pages/forge-spectral.md, pages/forge-warp.md, pages/forge.md, pages/git-workflow.md, pages/group-is-a-bus-track.md, pages/headless-ui-snapshots.md, pages/ids-not-pointers.md, pages/inc-edits-do-not-rebuild.md, pages/inputs-and-monitoring.md, pages/juce-isbold-misses-semibold.md, pages/juce-output-stream-appends.md, pages/keeping-files-small.md, pages/known-hazards.md, pages/locked-executable-lnk1104.md, pages/main-track.md, pages/measure-sound-dont-read-dsp.md, pages/mixer.md, pages/no-rhinoedit-back-compat.md, pages/note-editor.md, pages/off-limits-directories.md, pages/one-instrument-per-track.md, pages/orphaned-build-processes.md, pages/pattern-presets.md, pages/pattern-track.md, pages/playhead.md, pages/pointer-and-selection.md, pages/project-files.md, pages/proving-a-forge-change-changed-nothing.md, pages/reading-midi-hardware-on-windows.md, pages/real-time-audio-rules.md, pages/recording.md, pages/region-editing.md, pages/renders-that-never-return.md, pages/reproducing-live-timing-offline.md, pages/rhino-build-targets.md, pages/rhino-eq.md, pages/rhino-tune.md, pages/rhino-vocoder.md, pages/serum-patches-sound-different.md, pages/session-model.md, pages/session-view.md, pages/stack-overflow-reports-as-segfault.md, pages/time-warp.md, pages/track-and-clip-colours.md, pages/track-groups.md, pages/track-kind-fixed-at-creation.md, pages/track-kinds.md, pages/tracktion-and-juce.md, pages/transport.md, pages/writing-rhino-tests.md

## [2026-10-03] update | Forge's oscillator CRT loses its corner brackets
- updated: none (no page describes the oscillator CRT display)
- notes: `drawCrtScreen` in `instruments/rhino-forge/ui/ForgeDisplays.h` no longer draws L-shaped corner brackets inside the glass, and `drawDisplayBrackets` is gone (commit `0328983`). The user asked for this as a design preference, so do not put corner marks back on the CRT face. The graticule, zero axis, bezel glow and trace are unchanged.

## [2026-10-03] update | A switched-off Forge oscillator keeps its shared-cell knobs
- updated: pages/forge-editor.md (new "Rules that bite" entry: shared-cell hiding reads `inCharge`, not the module's switch; the label-counting trap in editor tests)

## [2026-10-03] update | Forge's plate legends give their strip to the knobs, and captions keep one size
- updated: pages/forge-editor.md (`Module` positional-initialiser trap; captions span their cell with no side border because `juce::Label` squashes then shrinks text that does not fit, guarded by `captionsKeepTheirSizeSuite`; plates have a 6 px `plateFootMargin` instead of the 20 px legend, commit `7be9a56`)
- updated: pages/forge-knob-diameter-is-panel-wide.md (shared diameter at 1440×900 now 46 px from 95×60 oscillator cells, was 43; the plate foot has no more height to give)

## [2026-10-03] update | The spectral oscillator keeps one pair of markers, the loop's
- updated: pages/forge-spectral.md (START/END and LS/LE removed, commit `dbd223d`; playback spans the whole sample; loop markers shown and draggable only when `spectralLoopReachesLoop`, hidden rather than faded; why one pair; `loopMarkersSuite`)
- updated: pages/forge-editor.md (a parameter dragged on a display must be listed in `displayParameters` for the layout test)
- updated: pages/inc-edits-do-not-rebuild.md (a `Copy-Item` restore keeps the older timestamp, so MSBuild keeps the object built from a temporary edit; touch or restore by editing)
- updated: pages/build-and-test-forge.md (pointer to that trap when proving a check can fail)

## [2026-10-03] update | START and END return for ONE-SHOT and MANUAL, and spectral gets a flat display
- updated: pages/forge-spectral.md (commit `bbc2b85` supersedes `dbd223d`'s one-pair decision: each loop mode reads exactly one marker pair, START/END for ONE-SHOT and MANUAL, the loop for the rest, and only that pair is drawn or grabbed; no value fields by user request; the pixel-rounded drag value trap in tests; new "The display" section on the square spectral well replacing the CRT tube)
- updated: pages/forge-editor.md (`displayParameters` now lists all four spectral markers)
